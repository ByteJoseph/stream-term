# Stream-term

Hey there, fellow coders! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Stream-term, a fun little project that brings the hacker vibe to your browser. Ever wanted to feel like you're in a movie, furiously typing away at a terminal? Well, now you can!

## What's this all about?

Stream-term is a web app that lets you play around with a terminal-like interface. It's built using Streamlit, which means it's super easy to get up and running. Here's what you can do:

- Run system commands right from your browser (careful now, with great power comes great responsibility! ðŸ˜‰)
- Enjoy that classic green-on-black hacker aesthetic
- Check out some basic system info, because why not?
- Pretend you're "connecting to the mainframe" with a fancy progress bar (Hollywood, here we come!)

## Getting Started

1. First things first, make sure you've got Python installed. If not, go grab it!
2. Clone this repo (or download it, we're not picky)
3. Install Streamlit:
   ```
   pip install streamlit
   ```
   (Don't worry, it'll grab the other stuff we need too)

## Fire it up!

Ready to hack the planet? Here's how:

1. Open up your terminal (the real one, not our fake one)
2. Navigate to where you put the files
3. Run this command:
   ```
   streamlit run main.py
   ```
4. Your browser should pop open with Stream-term ready to go. If not, it'll tell you where to go (usually http://localhost:8501)

## How to Use

1. Type in a command (like `ls` or `echo "Hello, World!"`)
2. Hit that "Execute" button
3. Watch the magic happen!
4. Check out the sidebar for some extra goodies

## Make it Your Own

Feel like the green is too... green? Want to channel your inner blue hacker instead? No problem! Just find the `css` variable in `main.py` and go wild. Change colors, fonts, whatever floats your boat!

## A Friendly Warning

Remember, this thing can run real system commands. So maybe don't use it on a server with nuclear launch codes or anything, okay? Stay safe out there!
